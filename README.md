## Build status
Get the current build here:
[Realeases](https://github.com/jamestrose/python-keylogger/releases/)

## Features
Pretty standard keylogger built in Python 3, can either be run using the python script (requires Python 3 installed) or using the packaged .exe

## Tests
I will be improving the detection rate and testing it with Virus Total, 1.0 is being detected by 17 of the 70 AV engines.

## How to use?
Once the keylogger is ran, it will remain a background process and collect the key inputs (obviously) and the window name in which the text is being inputed. The output applog.txt document will be in the hidden App Data folder.
